                    <h2> Welcome to my Project </h2>
                    <p> In this project I'll showing how the global economy is deeply connected. To demostrate this, I will be outlining the process of making something as simple as a T-shirt, from the harvest of its raw materials to its distribution to local retailers. Along with that I will also explain what happens if any of the countries involved in the process are taken out of the equation.</p>
